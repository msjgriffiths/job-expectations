      <h2>Base Skills</h2>

      <p>The following is organized as a table. Each row is a <em>bucket</em>, and each cell is a collection of behaviors that related that to bucket. It some cases the bucket can be very general, and in other cases highly specific. This classification is not intended to be authoritative, and is subject to change (feel free to disagree or ask for classification).</p>

      <p><strong>Please note</strong> that no one can do <em>all</em> of these at the <strong>Advanced</strong> level. Rather, these are skills that an employee can choose to focus on. </p>

      <p>For example, not everyone needs to be very good at presentation creation or delivery. In many cases it would not be effective to spend a lot of time improving presentation capability because the application is limited.</p>

      <p>Additionally, some skills are more or less important. An inability to communicate effectively &ndash; in both comprehension and articulation &ndash; increases the amount of work that you, and the rest of the team, need to do. At best, this is inefficient.</p>

      <h3>Outcomes</h3>

      <p>The best way to approach a job is to understand that people care out <em>outcomes</em>, and not <em>inputs</em>. Frequently, the work each employee contributes affects only a small part of the outcome. It's easy to focus on your piece, and not the total outcome, since (a) that what you know and (b) that's what you can control. However, to be <strong>truly effective</strong>, it's important to examine the actual output and understand how the work you do contributes.</p>

      <p>This perspective is important because it provides a framework in which you can evaluate changes in your own work. Is there something you can do that would increase the quality of the outcome, but that nobody has asked for? Does changing some way in which you deliver or perform the work affect how useful the work is? For example, delivering an analysis in Excel might be more helpful if people are likely to use the Excel document to investigate the analysis. But it might be <em>less</em> helpful if you know the people looking at the result won't have time to look around, or wouldn't understand what they were looking at if they did. In that case, it makes sense to deliver the results differently (perhaps as a document explaining the results and their interpretation, or as PowerPoint slides people can drop into a presentation with slide notes describing the slides) - <em>even if they actually ask for an Excel document</em>. You should "push back" and propose delivering differently. (Note: don't deliver something different without asking first. Your judgement may be wrong).</p>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>

      <p>Teamwork is important because it can significantly increase the quality or quantity of outcomes. By "teamwork" people mean two things: <em>alignment</em>, and (lack of) <em>friction</em>. Alignment is the idea that everyone is working on the same thing, and trying to achieve the same goal. Even if any individual disagrees about the goal or how the team is doing it, they still work <strong>to the best of their ability</strong> to achieve that goal or ensure its success. Disagreement can &ndash; and should &ndash; occur, but that should not translate to sabotaging efforts by withdrawing contributions.</p>

      <p>Friction has to do with how easily things can happen. Practically, at the individual level, the goal is to make each interaction you (the employee) has with any other member of the team as easy as possible. More formally, to reduce the <em>transaction cost</em> of interactions. The easier someone is to interact, the more interaction people will want to do, and the more interactions will take place: thus, the greater the value (ceteris paribus). Exceptions are where interactions ("transactions") do not add value, and their frequency "crowds out" valuable work.</p>

      <h3>Data Scientist</h3>

      <p>Skills that apply to a data scientist. The most important thing to realize as a data scientist is that you exist to <em>help people make decisions</em>. There are three parts of that:</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Help</strong>: Helping is to focus on the other person and what they need. It's much less relevant what you can <em>do</em> (e.g. unsupervised clustering technique with clever variable transforms to improve outcomes) than how you can <em>help</em> (e.g. identifying and providing a few simple business rules to separate groups). If the end (business) user needs to explain the results of the work, and you deliver a complex result that requires another two weeks of work to interpret and understand the clusters, you haven't helped.</li>
          <li><strong>People</strong>: Different people interact with the world differently, and come from different levels of knowledge. As a data scientist, part of you job is to bridge the gap between their understanding and what you can contribute (i.e. it's not on them to communicate to you in a way you understand: that's your job).</li>
          <li><strong>Decisions</strong>: In most cases (in an agency) the goal is to make a decision. That might be more abstract &mdash; "What kind of people should we show ads to?" &mdash; or concrete, e.g. "Which of my ads had an impact on consumers?." You should focus on the decision that someone needs to make. Performing work in isolation of understanding that decision is unlikely to be useful.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>All of this is complicated by how difficult it is to work in an organziation.</p>

      <p>Considerations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Most people are bad at explaining the question they want to answer.</li>
        <li>Many people assume that statistics or machine learning is "magic"</li>
        <li>People may not understand the different types of errors</li>
        <li>The data source can have a tremendous impact</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It may help to think of the job &ndash; that of a <em>statistician</em> or a <em>data analyst</em> &ndash; in terms of impact. What change can a data analyst have in an organization, in the best possible world? Ideally, a data analyst can extract:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>All meaning from data</strong>: There may be information or patterns in the data that non-experts would overlook, not understand, or not think to look for. In a perfect world, an analyst would ensure that all possible meaning is extracted from a data set.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid errors</strong>: People enjoy making decisions based on their personal opinions. A data analyst can ensure that decisions (a) are backed by data, (b) use statistics to reduce the chance of error, and (c) identify where data may be necessary to collect, now or in the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Neither of these are possible in practice, but it's possible to get closer. </p>
