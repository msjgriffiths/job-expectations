# Job Standards

This is an attempt to describe a job, and the facets that *could* go into the job. It's **not** an attempt to define a level of performance - that varies by job and should be determined based on a conversation between manager and direct.

Instead, it's a list of areas encompassed by the job and descriptions of what would comprise "basic", "intermediate", and "advanced" performance in each area. In practice, each employee may only focus on a handful of areas. 

The goal of this is to reduce ambiguity in what a job is, and what good versus "okay" performance is.
